Re:Aria intends to act as additional content to the Origins mod, adding (hopefully) balanced but entertaining content that provides an enjoyable experience. Unfortunately, each origin may not be disabled easily from the select screen (for now). 

A decent amount of these origins are optimized/intended for combat purposes however the origins will improve for single-player use. Hopefully, my current work can meet that standard, if you believe it doesn’t then let me know.

## Origins
